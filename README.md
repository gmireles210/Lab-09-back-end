# City Explorer? Lab9

**Author**: Crystal and Greg
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
The project was for 301 in which we built upon existing knowledge from previous classes which utilized databases, constructors, functions, and a schema from sql.
## Getting Started
The steps would be to set-up a server on their machine, set-up Heroku for an app (which will be used to deploy this project, and a GitHub Repo to house the code. From there you would need API's from each places you plan on pulling data from and ensuring to authenticate the keys, this way your code will pull the required data. Ensure all of your services are set-up properly, this will alleviate future errors during deployment and functionality of your code/associated services.

## Architecture
This project uses node.js, express, Heroku, Postgresql, and JS. The code was eventually broken down into modules that were called on through the server.js along with all relevant keys needed to access the specific sites. This was accomplished by using a .env, thus negating have live API keys on an open-sources platform.
